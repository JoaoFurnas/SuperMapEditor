# SuperMapEditor
Project originally created as part of #32 thunderSTRUCTs bootCamp from Academia de Codigo. After conclusion of proposed exercise MapEditor exercise, I added multiple features and made this project much more complex from what it was originally intended to be. Allows drawing with mouse, select multiple tools and drawing sizes.
